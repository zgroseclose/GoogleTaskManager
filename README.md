# GoogleTaskManager

------------------------------------------

### Google Task Manager is a program that will scrape data from WebAssign (potentially WolfWare also) and inport it to the default Google Task list for the current user in the default browser. It is currently a *work in progress*.

------------------------------------------

#### TODO:
+ Add scrape from WebAssign
+ Add Scrape from WolfWare
+ ~~Work on time implementation (in-progress)~~ **Done**
+ Better command line usability
+ Maybe a GUI/Web interface
