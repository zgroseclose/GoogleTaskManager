# GoogleTaskManager

------------------------------------------

### Google Task Manager is a program that will scrape data from WebAssign (potentially WolfWare also) and inport it to the default Google Task list for the current user in the default browser. It is currently a *work in progress*.

#### TODO:
+ ~~Add scrape from WebAssign~~ **Done**
+ Add Scrape from WolfWare (Next!)
+ ~~Work on time implementation~~ **Done**
+ Better command line usability
